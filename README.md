# Heart-Failure-Prediction
This project, titled Heart Failure Prediction, involves the use of machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart failure based on a clinical dataset. The dataset used contains clinical records of patients and includes features such as age, anaemia status, high blood pressure, creatinine phosphokinase levels, diabetes status, ejection fraction, platelet count, serum creatinine, serum sodium, sex, smoking status, and the duration of follow-up. The target variable, indicating whether the patient experienced a death event, is used to train classification models.

The main objective of the project is to apply various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest, and compare their performance in predicting heart failure. Model evaluation is conducted using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrices. Visualizations are included to help understand feature distributions and model effectiveness.The technologies used include Python with libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and optionally XGBoost and Streamlit. To run the project, the user should have Python 3 installed along with the mentioned libraries. After installing the dependencies, the user can open the notebook using Jupyter and run each cell to follow the project workflow.
